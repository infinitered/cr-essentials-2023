### Chapter 1

# Getting Started

In this chapter, we will:

- Set up our development environment for React Native
- Learn how to run our first React Native app using Expo
- Explore how to make changes to our app and see them reflected in real-time using Expo Go

## Tasks

### Pre-requisites

1. Make sure your environment is [set up for react native development](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)
2. Fork this repo & Clone your fork
3. Run `yarn install` from the project root to install dependencies

### Tasks for this section

1. Run `npx expo start` from the project root
2. Launch the app using one of the options and check everything is working!
3. Open `./App.tsx` and change something. Make sure your changes appear on the app screen.

### Options if you finish early

1. Help your neighbor with their setup issues!
2. Tweet about how much fun you're having at #ChainReactConf!
3. Unsure what to do next? Ask Chat-GPT for a good Pannekoeken recipe!

### What's Essential About React Native?

Building great apps with React Native is about more than just learning the API. It's about understanding the platform and the ecosystem.

We think there are four essential areas to focus on:

1. User Experience
   - User experience is critical to the success of any app. Users expect apps to be fast, responsive, and intuitive.
   - React Native is a great tool for building apps that feel great to use.
2. Performance
   - Performance is a key part of user experience. Users expect apps to be fast and responsive.
   - There are some performance challenges that are unique to React Native. We'll cover those in this workshop.

3. Reusability
   - One of the core ideas behind React Native is that you can share code between platforms, and reuse components throughout your app.
   - We'll look at how to structure our code to maximize reusability, and to make flexible components that can be used in many different contexts.

4. Developer Experience
   - Part of what makes React Native so great is the developer experience. It's easy to get started, and there are a ton of great tools to help you build your app.
   - We'll look at some of the tools that make React Native development so great, and how to use them effectively.

### Expo

Expo is an open-source platform for creating universal native apps using React for Android, iOS, and the web. It offers
a set of tools and services built around React Native, helping developers create and deploy their apps quickly.

Expo simplifies the development process by managing the complex aspects of mobile app development. With Expo, you can
focus on your app's core features while the platform handles the underlying infrastructure.

### Expo Go

Expo Go is the official Expo client app for iOS and Android. It allows you to run your Expo projects directly on your
device without manual installation.

The app streamlines the development process, enabling quick previews and testing of your React Native apps. Simply scan
the QR code generated by the Expo CLI, and Expo Go loads your app, reflecting live changes made to your code.

Expo Go is essential for developers working with Expo, as it accelerates development and testing cycles.
